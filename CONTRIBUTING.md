# Contributor's Guide
The Automatic Component Toolkit is an open source project.

Contributions are welcome and we are looking for people that can improve existing language bindings or create new bindings or implementation stubs.

You can also contribute by reporting bugs in the [Issue tracker](https://git.autodesk.com/netfabb/AutomaticComponentToolkit/issues), helping review pull requests, participate in discussions about issues and more.

## Filing issues
1. When filing an issue to report errors or problems, make sure to answer these five questions:
	1. Which version of ACT are you using?
		Run <br/>`act.* -v`<br/> to print ACT's version.
	2. Which operating system, programming language(s) and development tools (compiler/interpreter) are you using?
	3. What did you do?
	4. What did you expect to see?
	5. What did you see instead?

2. When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the [maintainers](#maintainers) of this repository. This way, we can ensure that there is no overlap between contributions or internal development work.
