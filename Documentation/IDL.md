# Elements and types in the ACT-IDL

## 1. Component
Element **\<component>** of type **CT\_Component**

![element component](images/element_component.png)

##### Attributes
| Name | Type | Use | Default | Annotation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| libraryname | **ST\_LibraryName** | required | | Specifies the name of the component. Can contain spaces. |
| namespace | **ST\_NameSpace** | required | | Specifies the namespace for the components's functionality. |
| copyright | **xs:string** | required | | The legal copyright holder. |
| basename | **ST\_BaseName** | required | | The basename will be used as prefix for generated filenames and all sorts of identifiers in the generated source code. |
| version | **ST\_Version** | required | | The semantic version of this component. |
| year | **ST\_Year** | optional | the current year | The year associcated with the copyright. |
| @anyAttribute | | | | |

It is RECOMMENDED that components generated with ACT follow the [semantic versioning scheme](https://semver.org/).
The "version" attribute encodes the semantic version of this component. Major, Minor and Micro-version info MUST be included. Pre-release information and build information MAY be included.

The \<component> element is the root element of a ACT-IDL file.
There MUST be exactly one \<component> element in a ACT-IDL file.
A component MUST have exactly one child [license](#3-license) element, 
one child [bindings](#5-bindings) element, 
one child [implementations](#6-implementations) element, 
one child [errors](#16-errors) element and 
one child [global](#8-global) element.

The names of the \<struct>-, \<enum>-, \<functiontype>- and \<class>-elements MUST be unique within the \<component>.

>**Note:** Regarding the \"uniqueness\" of attributes of type **xs:string**.
>Within this specification strings are considered equal regardless of the case of the individual letters.

## 2. Import Component
Element **\<importcomponent>** of type **CT\_ImportComponent**
![element importcomponent](images/element_importcomponent.png)

The \<importcomponent> element defines the namespace and the relative location of another ACT-IDL-file and is the mechanism that allows injecting another ACT-component into the ACT-component at hand.

The `namespace` attribute of the \<importcomponent> element MUST match the `namespace` of the \<component> element within the file at location of the `uri` attribute.

The `class`es, `functiontype`s, `struct`s and `enum`s of the importend component with will be available as `param`s of methods in this ACT-component. 
To use an entity with name `Y` from another ACT component (with namespace `X`) as `class` of a `param` in this ACT component set the `class`-attribute to `class="X:Y"`.

To be able to inject a component `Inner` into a component `Outer`, component `Inner` must define the `symbollookupmethod` in its global section and component `Outer` must define the `injectionmethod`.

>**Note:** Component injection is an advanced feature. Not all bindings support it.
> See [the Injection example](../Examples/Injection) for a minimal working example.

The \<global> element contains a list of [method](#10-function-type) elements that define the exported global functions of the component.
The names of the \<method> elements MUST be unique within the \<global> element.

The `baseclassname`-attribute must be the name of a \<class> element within the components list of classes.
This class will be the base class for all classes of the generated component.

The `releasemethod`- and `acquiremethod`-attributes must each be the name of a \<method> within the \<global> element of a component that has exactly one parameter with `type="class"`, `class="BaseClass"` and `pass="in"`.

The `prereleasemethod`-attribute is optional an can be the name of a \<method> within the \<global> element of a component that has two parameters.
The first parameter MUST be of type `type="bool"` and `pass="return"`, the second parameter MUST be of type `type="string"` and `pass="out"`.
The `buildinfomethod`-attribute is optional an can be the name of a \<method> within the \<global> element of a component that has two parameters.

1. `type="class"`, `class="$BASECLASSNAME"` and `pass="in"`, where `"$BASECLASSNAME"` is the value of the `baseclassname` attribute of the \<global> element.
2. `type="string"` and `pass="out"`: outputs the last error message
3. `type="bool"` and `pass="return"`: returns the instance of the baseclass has an error.

The implemntation of this method is fully autogenerated and returns the address of another internal lookup method. This internal lookup method in turn is similar to a `GetProcAddress`- or `dlsym`-method: given the name of a method in this component, it provides the address of a method in this component with this name. The return value of the `symbollookupmethod` is usually passed into the `injectionmethod` of another component.

If the `journalmethod` attribute is given, it must be the name of a \<method> within the \<global> element of a method that has exactly one parameter with `type="string"` and `pass="in"`.

The \<class> element contains a list of [method](#10-function-type) elements that define the exported member functions of this class.
The names of the \<method> elements MUST be unique in this list.

If the `parent`-attribute is empty, and the name of this class differs from the `baseclassname`-attribute of the \<global> element, `baseclassname` will be considered as the parent class of this class.

A class MUST be defined in the list of \<class> elements before it is used as parent-class of another class. This restiction rules out circular inheritance. Moreover, the default `baseclassname` MUST be defined as the first \<class> within the IDL-file.

## 18. Simple Types
The simple types of this specification encode features, concepts, data types,
and naming rules used in or required by programming languages.

For now, please look the up in the [ACT.xsd](../Source/ACT.xsd).

### 18.1 Type
Supported types are:
- `bool`: denotes a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
Although this can be encoded in a single bit, the thin C89-layer APIs generated by ACT will use an unsigned 8 bit value (a `uint8` in ACT terms) to encode a boolean value.
A numerical value of `0` encodes `false`, all oher values encode `true`.
Implementations and bindings should use the definition of a boolean value that is native to the respective language of the implementation or binding.
- `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`:
An _unsigned_ integer vaules ranging from 0 - 2<sup>8</sup>-1, 0 - 2<sup>16</sup>-1, 0 - 2<sup>32</sup>-1, 0 - 2<sup>64</sup>-1, respectively.
- `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`:
A _signed_ integer vaules ranging from -2<sup>7</sup> - 2<sup>7</sup>-1, -2<sup>15</sup> - 2<sup>15</sup>-1,
-2<sup>31</sup> - 2<sup>31</sup>-1,
-2<sup>63</sup> - 2<sup>63</sup>-1, respectively.
- `pointer`: An address in memory without knowledge of the kind of data that resides there. In C++, this corresponds to a `void*`.
- `string` denotes a null-terminated string. If a component requires arbitrary strings that can contain null-characters, one should use the type `basicarray` of class `uint8`. When using `string` as `out`- or `return`-parameter, the size of the buffer that is passed through the ABI includes the terminating null-character.

- `single`: Single precision floating point number.
- `double`: Double precision floating point number.
- `struct`: see [13. Struct](#14-struct)
- `enum`: see [11. Enum](#12-enum)
- `basicarray`: an array of [ST\_ScalarTypes](#18-2-scalartype)
- `enumarray`: an array of [enums](#12-enum)
- `structarray`: an array of [structs](#14-struct)
- `functiontype`: see [9. Function Type](#10-function-type)
- `class`: the identifier (address, unique identifier, hash, ...) of a class instance [class instance](#9-class)

**Note**
 `type="handle"` is equivalent to `type="class"` for backwards compatibility. It will be removed in a future version.

### 18.2 ScalarType
A subset of scalar or integral of ST\_Type:

`bool`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `single`, `double`, `pointer`.

### 18.3 ComposedType
A subset of more complex types, or types composed of other ST\_Types:

`string`, `enum`, `basicarray`, `enumarray`, `structarray`, `class`, `functiontype`
